Queue.
Implement the queue data structure.
1. First In First Out. A unidirectional linked list with a tail pointer.
2. First In First Out. A unidirectional linked list without a tail pointer.
3. Implement a bidirectional list - you can move not only from head to tail, 
but also from tail to head. This will speed up the execution of the get function.
4. Implement stack - LIFO - Last In First Out.
5. Implement Robot Visualization section using our queue.

Robot visualization.

Robot properties.
1. Walking forward.
2. Turns.
3. The robot will remember the entire path that it has 
passed - that is, it will keep a queue of straight lines that it has passed.
