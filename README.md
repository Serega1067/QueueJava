Queue.
Implement the queue data structure.
1. First In First Out. A unidirectional linked list with a tail pointer.
2. First In First Out. A unidirectional linked list without a tail pointer.
3. Implement a bidirectional list - you can move not only from head to tail, 
but also from tail to head. This will speed up the execution of the get function.
